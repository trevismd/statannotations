## What is it

Python package to optionally compute statistical test and add statistical
annotations on plots generated with seaborn.

## Derived work

This repository is based on
[webermarcolivier/statannot](https://github.com/webermarcolivier/statannot)
 (commit 1835078 of Feb 21, 2020, tagged "v0.2.3").

Additions/modifications since that version are below represented **in bold**
(previous fixes are not listed).

**! From version 0.4.0 onwards (introduction of `Annotator`), `statannot`'s API 
is no longer usable in `statannotations`**. 
Please use the latest v0.3.2 release if you must keep `statannot`'s API in your 
code, but are looking for bug fixes we have covered.

Indeed, the statannot interface, at least until its version 0.2.3, is usable in
statannotations until v.0.3.x, which already provides additional features (see
corresponding branch).

## Features

- Single function to add statistical annotations on plots
  generated by seaborn:
    - Box plots
    - Bar plots
    - **Swarm plots**
    - **Strip plots**
    - **Violin plots** 
    - Supporting `FacetGrid`
- Integrated statistical tests (binding to `scipy.stats` methods):
    - Mann-Whitney
    - t-test (independent and paired)
    - Welch's t-test
    - Levene test
    - Wilcoxon test
    - Kruskal-Wallis test
- **Interface to use any other function from any source with minimal extra
  code**
- Smart layout of multiple annotations with correct y offsets.
- **Support for vertical and horizontal orientation**
- Annotations can be located inside or outside the plot.
- **Corrections for multiple testing can be applied
  (binding to `statsmodels.stats.multitest.multipletests` methods):**
    - Bonferroni
    - Holm-Bonferroni
    - Benjamini-Hochberg
    - Benjamini-Yekutieli
- **And any other function from any source with minimal extra code**
- Format of the statistical test annotation can be customized:
      star annotation, simplified p-value format, or explicit p-value.
- Optionally, custom p-values can be given as input.
      In this case, no statistical test is performed, but **corrections for
      multiple testing can be applied.**
- Any text can be used as annotation
- And various fixes (see
  [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/trevismd/statannotations/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)).

## Installation

From version 0.3.0 on, the package is distributed on PyPi.
The latest stable release (v0.4.2) can be downloaded and installed with:
```bash
pip install statannotations
```

or, after cloning the repository,
```bash
pip install .

# OR, to have optional dependencies too (multiple comparisons & testing)
pip install -r requirements.txt .
```

## Usage

Here is a minimal example:

```python
import seaborn as sns

from statannotations.Annotator import Annotator

df = sns.load_dataset("tips")
x = "day"
y = "total_bill"
order = ['Sun', 'Thur', 'Fri', 'Sat']

ax = sns.boxplot(data=df, x=x, y=y, order=order)

pairs=[("Thur", "Fri"), ("Thur", "Sat"), ("Fri", "Sun")]

annotator = Annotator(ax, pairs, data=df, x=x, y=y, order=order)
annotator.configure(test='Mann-Whitney', text_format='star', loc='outside')
annotator.apply_and_annotate()
```
