## Contributing to statannotations
Thank you for your interest! This package is truly the work of multiple
developers and participating users and this mustn't change.

Contributions are appreciated in all their forms, such as the opening of new
issues when discovering a (possible) bug, suggestion/upvote new features,
participation to discussions, improvements of the documentation, etc.

If you wish specifically to submit code changes, please use the following
guide:
- [ ] If it is not an answer to an open issue, please consider opening one
  first, even more if the changes are major and/or possibly controversial
- [ ] Make sure to have the dev dependencies installed: `packaging` and
  `statsmodels`
- Fork the repository and make a new branch from the latest `dev` commit
- [ ] Make your code modifications, including unit testing if possible.
  Please follow PEP8 guidelines.
- [ ] Run the test suite and make sure previous (and new) tests pass
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md to describe your changes
- [ ] Open a PR to the `dev` branch, containing at least what was added to the
  changelog, as well as a reference to the issue if any
